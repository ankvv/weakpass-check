## Usage

You can run this program from the command line. Below are the available commands:

### 1. Search for a Hash

To search for a single hash:
```bash
python weakpass-check.py search <hash>
```
To search for hashes from a file (one hash per line):
```bash
python weakpass-check.py search --file <file_path>
```
### 2. Retrieve Hash Ranges

To retrieve hash-password pairs based on a prefix:
```bash
python weakpass-check.py range <prefix> [--filter {hash,pass}] [--type {md5,ntlm,sha1,sha256}]
```
### 3. List Available Wordlists

To get a list of available wordlists:
```bash
python weakpass-check.py wordlists
```
## Example

# Search for a specific hash
```bash
# Searching for a single hash
python weakpass-check.py search 5f4dcc3b5aa765d61d8327deb882cf99
```
# Search for hashes listed in a file
```bash
python weakpass-check.py search --file hashes.txt
```
# Retrieve hash-password pairs for a prefix
```bash
python weakpass-check.py range a1b2c3
```
# List available wordlists
```bash
python weakpass-check.py wordlists
```

## Error Handling
